> I want to build a fully automated **Messenger bot system using Flask and SQLite** that allows users to interact without human intervention and complete an order through structured steps. The system should be connected to a **custom built-in admin web interface** (not an external website) with RTL Arabic support and full data management features. Here's exactly what I want:
>
> ### **Core Bot Features:**
> - When a user sends any message, the bot greets them and shows an introduction.
> - The bot displays selectable options:  
>   1. Place an Order  
>   2. View Prices  
>   3. Talk to Customer Support
> - If the user chooses "View Prices", the bot shows product categories or a product list (stored in DB or JSON).
> - If the user chooses a product and wants to order, the bot asks for:
>   - Full Name  
>   - Phone Number  
>   - Address  
>   - (Optional) Order Notes
> - The bot confirms the order and shows a summary.
> - **I want full control over what the bot says at every step** — all bot messages must be editable from the admin panel or config file.
>
> ### **Admin Panel Features (Web Interface using Flask):**
> - Admin login system with secure authentication.
> - View all incoming orders in a dashboard.
> - Search/filter orders by name, date, phone, or product.
> - Change the order status (e.g., New, Processing, Delivered).
> - Real-time web notifications when a new order is received.
> - Display user’s Messenger name and real name submitted during the order.
> - Full Arabic support with RTL layout.
> - Dark mode for the dashboard.
>
> ### **Order Management Features:**
> - Generate PDF invoice for each order with:
>   - Customer name, phone, address, and product
>   - Business logo (customizable from settings)
> - Download order history as an Excel sheet.
> - Generate a unique **QR Code** for each order linking to order tracking or info.
> - Admin can add/edit/delete products from a product management page.
> - Admin can add notes to any order.
> - Automatic daily backup of the SQLite database.
> - Built-in analytics dashboard showing:
>   - Total orders
>   - Most ordered products
>   - Top customers
>
> ### **Extra Features:**
> - Logo upload and change option from admin panel.
> - Intelligent error handling with fallback messages.
> - Multilingual support (default Arabic, extendable to English).
> - WhatsApp or email notification to admin when an order is made.
> - Customers can track the status of their order using order ID.
> - Responsive mobile-friendly design.
> - Full control over all bot texts and responses.
